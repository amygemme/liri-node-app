#Media Search Tool

## Spotify Tool
This file is currently connected to the spotify API and is able to take in command and a search value.  The user must input spotify-this-song *title of a song* and the program will return information about that track.

If the user does not enter a track the program will return information on the track The Sign by Ace of Base.

##IMBD Tool

If the user does not enter a track the program will return information on the movie Mr. Nobody.

##Road Map
We will add a tool to search for concert tickets and we will add a tool that is able to read another text file in order to take commands.  

Currently the code needs updated to be able to accept songs titles with more than one word.  This will be an easy fit.
